Hi, I'm Nathan, I'm a jack-of-all-trades problem solver with experience in robotics and game-development. I've made various demo projects, especially in Godot, and I do a bulk load of software/electrical work for First Robotics Competition Team 2485, Overclocked. I specialize in electronics and odometry for the robotics team, but I have experience in CAD (Certified SolidWorks Associate) and PCB Design in KiCAD.
